# Learning & Practice Repository

This repository contains small experiments, configurations, and notes as I continue developing my software engineering skills.

It also serves as a space to maintain consistent GitHub contributions while learning and experimenting with tools like GitHub Actions, APIs, and modern JavaScript frameworks.

For complete projects, please see my other repositories.
